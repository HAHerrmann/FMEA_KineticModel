# Failure Mode and Effect Analysis 

We have taken a reliability engineering approach normally used to make suggestions for enhancing the performance of a product or process, in order to assess the functionality plant carbon metabolism.  The failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) nicely lends itself to formalizing a rigorous approach for ranking metabolites according to the risk that they pose to the system.  Using a network analysis to formally assess the probability of failure and the severity of failure of each metabolite, we were able to identify metabolites, which, if perturbed, will have the greatest effect on the entire network. 


# Diurnal Organic Acid Accumulation in Arabidopsis Modelled Across Six Temperatures 

During the day, Arabidopsis thaliana plants accumulate different forms of carbon which are then consumed at night.
Carbon is primarily accumulated in the form of starch and the organic acids (malate and fumarate). 

Here we are looking to explore how malate and fumarate accumulation changes as plants acclimate across different temperature ranges. 

For this we consider the genotypes Col-0, *fum2*, and C24 and temperature treat them for up to one week. 
We measured gas exchange and organic acid accumulation across 6 different temperatures: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 20 degrees Celsius.
