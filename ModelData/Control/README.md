The following model was created in COPASI and parametrized for control conditions using the experimentally measured concentration values at 20 degrees Celcius.

The results show that a change in FUM2 activity and Gas exchange values is sufficient to explain malate and fumarate across the three genotypes when an additional activation and inhibition is included is the model.

The basic model and the model which includes activation and inhibition (AI) are available. 

R file used to compare the experimental values and those predicted by the model is included.
