The following model was created in COPASI and parametrized for control conditions using the experimentally measured concentration values at 20 degrees Celcius.

The results show that a change in FUM2 activity and Gas exchange values is sufficient to explain malate and fumarate across the three genotypes. 

R file used to compare the experimental values and those predicted by the model is included.
